      <h1>Fungi</h1>
      <p>These organisms are classified as a kingdom, Fungi, which is separated from the othereukaryotic life kingdoms of plants and animals.</p>
      <p>A fungus is any member of the group of othereukaryotic organisms that includes unicellular microorganisns such as yeasts and molds, as well as multicellular fungi that produce familiar fruiting forms known as mushrooms.</p>

      <h2>Armillaria solidiped</h2>
      <p>Armillaria solidiped is known to be one of the largest living organisms, where scientists have estimated a single specimen found in Malheur National Forest in Oregon to have been growing for some 2,400 years, covering 8.4kmÂ² and colloquially names "humongous Fungus".</p>

      <h2>Polypores</h2>
      <p>Most polypores inhabit tree trunks or branches consuming the wood, but some soil-inhabiting species form mycorrhiza with trees. Polupores are the most important agents of wood decay-playing a very significant role in nutrient cycling and carbon dioxide production of forest ecosystems.</p>
